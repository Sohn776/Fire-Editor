# Fire-Editor
Revived Fire Emblem Awakening Save Editor.

In the vein of the [dead repo](https://github.com/adenine-dev/fire-editor); its non-existing hosting site and vanished new repo; and the slow loading [wayback machine version](https://web.archive.org/web/20210712161746/https://alexa-griffin.github.io/fire-editor2/#).

This is the downloaded version from the wayback machine. I'll simply host it via github pages so it loads faster.
